#verb
- **To ride such a [[board]]**
- **For a [[car]] or similar vehicle to slide [[along]] the road on a thin film of water [[between]] the road and the tyres. This occurs when a [[car]] has some speed and [[comes]] to somewhere with more water on the road than the weight of the [[car]] and the grooves in the tyre tread pattern (if [[any]]) [[can]] push [[away]]. The result is [[almost]] no traction at [[all]] for steering or [[braking]].**
