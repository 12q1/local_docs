#noun
- **An [[e/_electrode|electrode]], of a [[c/_cell|cell]] or other [[e/_electrically|electrically]] polarized [[d/_device|device]], through which a positive [[c/_current|current]] of [[e/_electricity|electricity]] flows inwards (and thus, [[e/_electrons|electrons]] flow outwards). It [[c/_can|can]] have [[e/_either|either]] a negative or a positive voltage.**
- **(by extension) The [[e/_electrode|electrode]] at which [[c/_chemical|chemical]] oxidation of [[a/_anions|anions]] takes place, usually resulting in the erosion of metal from the [[e/_electrode|electrode]].**
- **The [[e/_electrode|electrode]] which [[c/_collects|collects]] [[e/_electrons|electrons]] [[e/_emitted|emitted]] by the [[c/_cathode|cathode]] in a vacuum tube or gas-filled tube.**
- **That [[e/_electrode|electrode]] of a semiconductor [[d/_device|device]] which is [[c/_connected|connected]] to the p-type material of a p-n junction.**
