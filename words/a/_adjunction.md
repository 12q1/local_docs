# Adjunction
---
#noun
- **The [[act]] of joining; the thing joined or [[added]].**
- **The joining of personal property owned by one to that owned by [[another]].**
- **Given a pair of [[categories]] \mathcal{C} and \mathcal{D}: an [[anti]]-parallel pair of functors F:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow \mathcal{D} and G:\mathcal{D}\rightarrow \mathcal{C} and a natural transformation \eta:\mbox{id}_C \rightarrow GF [[called]] “unit” such that for [[any]] object A \in \mathcal{C}, for [[any]] object B \in \mathcal{D}, and for [[any]] morphism f:A\rightarrow GB, there is a unique morphism g:FA\rightarrow B such that Gg \[[circ]] \eta_A = f. (Note: there is [[another]] natural transformation [[called]] “counit” as well but its existence may be [[derived]] by theorem.) The pair of functors express a similarity [[between]] the pair of [[categories]] which is weaker than that of an equivalence of [[categories]].**
