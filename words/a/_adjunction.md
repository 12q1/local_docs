#noun
- **The [[a/_act|act]] of joining; the thing joined or [[a/_added|added]].**
- **The joining of personal property owned by one to that owned by [[a/_another|another]].**
- **Given a pair of [[c/_categories|categories]] \mathcal{[[c/_c|C]]} and \mathcal{[[d/_d|D]]}: an [[a/_anti|anti]]-parallel pair of functors F:\mathcal{[[c/_c|C]]}\rightarrow \mathcal{[[d/_d|D]]} and G:\mathcal{[[d/_d|D]]}\rightarrow \mathcal{[[c/_c|C]]} and a natural transformation \[[e/_eta|eta]]:\mbox{id}_C \rightarrow GF [[c/_called|called]] “unit” such that for [[a/_any|any]] object A \in \mathcal{[[c/_c|C]]}, for [[a/_any|any]] object [[b/_b|B]] \in \mathcal{[[d/_d|D]]}, and for [[a/_any|any]] morphism f:A\rightarrow GB, there is a unique morphism g:FA\rightarrow [[b/_b|B]] such that Gg \[[c/_circ|circ]] \eta_A = f. (Note: there is [[a/_another|another]] natural transformation [[c/_called|called]] “counit” as well but its existence may be [[d/_derived|derived]] by theorem.) The pair of functors express a similarity [[b/_between|between]] the pair of [[c/_categories|categories]] which is weaker than that of an [[e/_equivalence|equivalence]] of [[c/_categories|categories]].**
