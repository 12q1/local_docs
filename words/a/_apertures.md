# Apertures
---
#noun
- **An opening, gap, or hole, usually small and narrow**
	- _Example: an aperture in a wall_
- **Something which restricts the [[d/_diameter|diameter]] of the light path through one plane in an optical system.**
- **The [[d/_diameter|diameter]] of the [[a/_aperture|aperture]] (in the sense [[a/_above|above]]) which restricts the width of the light path through the whole system. For a telescope, this is the [[d/_diameter|diameter]] of the objective lens.**
	- _Example: This telescope has a 100cm aperture._
- **([[c/_communications|communications]]) The (typically) large-[[d/_diameter|diameter]] [[a/_antenna|antenna]] used for receiving and transmitting radio frequency [[e/_energy|energy]] [[c/_containing|containing]] the [[d/_data|data]] used in [[c/_communication|communication]] satellites, especially in the geostationary [[b/_belt|belt]]. For a [[c/_comsat|comsat]], this is typically a large reflective [[d/_dish|dish]] [[a/_antenna|antenna]]; sometimes [[c/_called|called]] an [[a/_array|array]].**
- **(of a right [[c/_circular|circular]] [[c/_cone|cone]]) The maximum [[a/_angle|angle]] [[b/_between|between]] the two generatrices.**
	- _Example: If the generatrix makes an angle θ to the axis, then the aperture is 2θ._
