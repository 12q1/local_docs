#verb

This occurs when there's [[e/_enough|enough]] heat in the [[c/_combustion|combustion]] [[c/_chamber|chamber]] to ignite the [[a/_air|air]] and fuel mixture without a spark, the same way that heat and pressure [[c/_cause|cause]] ignition in a [[d/_diesel|diesel]] [[e/_engine|engine]].**
	- _Example: The only reason the VW bug has a solenoid is to prevent it from dieseling._
