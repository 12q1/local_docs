Used to power [[d/_diesel|diesel]] [[e/_engines|engines]] which [[b/_burn|burn]] this [[f/_fuel|fuel]] using the [[h/_heat|heat]] produced when [[a/_air|air]] is [[c/_compressed|compressed]].**
- **A vehicle powered by a [[d/_diesel|diesel]] [[e/_engine|engine]].**
- **A rider who [[h/_has|has]] an [[e/_even|even]] [[e/_energy|energy]] [[o/_output|output]], without [[b/_bursts|bursts]] of speed.**

#verb
- **To [[i/_ignite|ignite]] a substance by using the [[h/_heat|heat]] [[g/_generated|generated]] by [[c/_compression|compression]]**
- **For a spark-[[i/_ignition|ignition]] [[i/_internal|internal]] [[c/_combustion|combustion]] [[e/_engine|engine]] to [[c/_continue|continue]] running [[a/_after|after]] the [[e/_electrical|electrical]] [[c/_current|current]] to the spark plugs [[h/_has|has]] [[b/_been|been]] turned [[o/_off|off]]. This [[o/_occurs|occurs]] when there's [[e/_enough|enough]] [[h/_heat|heat]] in the [[c/_combustion|combustion]] [[c/_chamber|chamber]] to [[i/_ignite|ignite]] the [[a/_air|air]] and [[f/_fuel|fuel]] [[m/_mixture|mixture]] without a spark, the same way that [[h/_heat|heat]] and pressure [[c/_cause|cause]] [[i/_ignition|ignition]] in a [[d/_diesel|diesel]] [[e/_engine|engine]].**
	- _Example: The only reason the VW bug has a solenoid is to prevent it from dieseling._
