#noun
- **A group, often named or numbered, to which items are [[a/_assigned|assigned]] [[b/_based|based]] on similarity or [[d/_defined|defined]] [[c/_criteria|criteria]].**
	- _Example: I wouldn't put this book in the same category as the author's first novel._
- **A [[c/_collection|collection]] of objects, together with a transitively [[c/_closed|closed]] [[c/_collection|collection]] of [[c/_composable|composable]] [[a/_arrows|arrows]] [[b/_between|between]] them, such that every object has an identity [[a/_arrow|arrow]], and such that [[a/_arrow|arrow]] [[c/_composition|composition]] is [[a/_associative|associative]].**
	- _Example: Just as a monoid consists of an underlying set with a binary operation "on top of it" which is closed, associative and with an identity, a category consists of an underlying digraph with an arrow composition operation "on top of it" which is transitively closed, associative, and with an identity at each object. In fact, a category's composition operation, when restricted to a single one of its objects, turns that object's set of arrows (which would all be loops) into a monoid._
