# Conchoids
---
#noun
- **Any of a family of curves defined as the locus of points p, such that each p is on a line that passes through a given fixed point P and intersects a given curve, C, and the distance from p to the point of intersection with C is a specified constant (note that for nontrivial cases two such points p satisfy the criteria, and the resultant curve has two parts).**
	- _Example: The Conchoid of Nicomedes is the conchoid of a straight line with respect to a point not on the line._
- **A conchoidal fracture in rock.**
