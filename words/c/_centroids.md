# Centroids
---
#noun
- **The point at the [[centre]] of [[any]] shape, sometimes [[called]] [[centre]] of [[area]] or [[centre]] of volume. For a triangle, the [[centroid]] is the point at which the medians intersect. The [[co]]-ordinates of the [[centroid]] are the [[average]] ([[arithmetic]] mean) of the [[co]]-ordinates of [[all]] the points of the shape. For a shape of uniform [[density]], the [[centroid]] [[coincides]] with the [[centre]] of mass which is [[also]] the [[centre]] of gravity in a uniform gravitational field.**
