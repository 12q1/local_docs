# Cathode

#noun
- **An [[e/_electrode|electrode]], of a [[c/_cell|cell]] or other [[e/_electrically|electrically]] polarized [[d/_device|device]], through which a positive [[c/_current|current]] of [[e/_electricity|electricity]] flows outwards (and thus, [[e/_electrons|electrons]] flow inwards). It usually, but not [[a/_always|always]], has a positive voltage.**
- **(by extension) The [[e/_electrode|electrode]] at which [[c/_chemical|chemical]] reduction of [[c/_cations|cations]] takes place, usually resulting in the [[d/_deposition|deposition]] of metal onto the [[e/_electrode|electrode]].**
- **The [[e/_electrode|electrode]] from which [[e/_electrons|electrons]] are [[e/_emitted|emitted]] into a vacuum tube or gas-filled tube.**
- **That [[e/_electrode|electrode]] of a semiconductor [[d/_device|device]] which is [[c/_connected|connected]] to the n-type material of a p-n junction.**
