- **A solid of revolution formed by rotating a triangle [[around]] one of its [[altitudes]].**
- **A space formed by taking the direct product of a given space with a [[closed]] interval and identifying [[all]] of one end to a point.**
- **Anything shaped like a [[cone]].**
- **The fruit of a [[conifer]].**
- **A [[cone]]-shaped flower head of various plants, such as [[banksias]] and proteas.**
- **An ice [[cream]] [[cone]].**

- **An object V together with an [[arrow]] going from V to each object of a diagram such that for [[any]] [[arrow]] A in the diagram, the pair of [[arrows]] from V which subtend A [[also]] [[commute]] with it. (Then V [[can]] be said to be the [[cone]]’s vertex and the diagram which the [[cone]] subtends [[can]] be said to be its [[base]].)**
	- _Example: A cone is an object (the apex) and a natural transformation from a constant functor (whose image is the apex of the cone and its identity morphism) to a diagram functor. Its components are projections from the apex to the objects of the diagram and it has a “naturality triangle” for each morphism in the diagram. (A “naturality triangle” is just a naturality square which is degenerate at its apex side.)_
- **A shell of the genus Conus, having a [[conical]] form.**
- **A set of formal languages with [[certain]] [[desirable]] [[closure]] properties, in particular those of the regular languages, the [[context]]-free languages and the recursively enumerable languages.**
