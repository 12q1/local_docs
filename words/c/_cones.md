- **A [[p/_passenger|passenger]] on a [[c/_cruise|cruise]] ship (so-[[c/_called|called]] by [[e/_employees|employees]] [[a/_after|after]] traffic [[c/_cones|cones]], from the [[n/_need|need]] to [[n/_navigate|navigate]] [[a/_around|around]] them)**
- **An [[o/_object|object]] V together with an [[a/_arrow|arrow]] [[g/_going|going]] from V to [[e/_each|each]] [[o/_object|object]] of a [[d/_diagram|diagram]] such that for [[a/_any|any]] [[a/_arrow|arrow]] A in the [[d/_diagram|diagram]], the [[p/_pair|pair]] of [[a/_arrows|arrows]] from V which subtend A [[a/_also|also]] [[c/_commute|commute]] with it. (Then V [[c/_can|can]] be said to be the [[c/_cone|cone]]’s vertex and the [[d/_diagram|diagram]] which the [[c/_cone|cone]] subtends [[c/_can|can]] be said to be [[i/_its|its]] [[b/_base|base]].)**
	- _Example: A cone is an object (the apex) and a natural transformation from a constant functor (whose image is the apex of the cone and its identity morphism) to a diagram functor. Its components are projections from the apex to the objects of the diagram and it has a “naturality triangle” for each morphism in the diagram. (A “naturality triangle” is just a naturality square which is degenerate at its apex side.)_
