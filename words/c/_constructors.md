#noun
- **A person who, or thing that, [[constructs]].**
- **A [[company]] or individual who [[builds]] racing vehicles. In Formula One, constructor status is strictly [[defined]] by the rules, but in other motorsports the term is merely a [[descriptor]]. Depending on the racing rules, some [[constructors]] (e.g. Cosworth) may provide vehicles to racing teams who are not themselves [[constructors]], while others are [[both]] teams and [[constructors]] (Ducati Corse, Scuderia Ferrari).**
- **A [[class]] method that [[creates]] and initializes each instance of an object.**
