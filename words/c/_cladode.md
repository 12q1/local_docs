#noun
- **A flattened organ [[arising]] from the stem of a plant. These often replace the leaves in photosynthetic function, as leaves in such plants (for example [[asparagus]], [[butchers]] [[broom]]) are typically reduced to scales. The term may [[also]] refer to the generally flattened shoot such as the [[cactus]] shown.**
