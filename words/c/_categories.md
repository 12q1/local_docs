- **A [[g/_group|group]], [[o/_often|often]] [[n/_named|named]] or [[n/_numbered|numbered]], to which [[i/_items|items]] are [[a/_assigned|assigned]] [[b/_based|based]] on [[s/_similarity|similarity]] or [[d/_defined|defined]] [[c/_criteria|criteria]].**
	- _Example: I wouldn't put this book in the same category as the author's first novel._
- **A [[c/_collection|collection]] of [[o/_objects|objects]], together with a transitively [[c/_closed|closed]] [[c/_collection|collection]] of [[c/_composable|composable]] [[a/_arrows|arrows]] [[b/_between|between]] them, [[s/_such|such]] that [[e/_every|every]] [[o/_object|object]] [[h/_has|has]] an [[i/_identity|identity]] [[a/_arrow|arrow]], and [[s/_such|such]] that [[a/_arrow|arrow]] [[c/_composition|composition]] is [[a/_associative|associative]].**
	- _Example: Just as a monoid consists of an underlying set with a binary operation "on top of it" which is closed, associative and with an identity, a category consists of an underlying digraph with an arrow composition operation "on top of it" which is transitively closed, associative, and with an identity at each object. In fact, a category's composition operation, when restricted to a single one of its objects, turns that object's set of arrows (which would all be loops) into a monoid._
