(Then V [[c/_can|can]] be [[s/_said|said]] to be the [[c/_cone|cone]]’[[s/_s|s]] vertex and the [[d/_diagram|diagram]] which the [[c/_cone|cone]] subtends [[c/_can|can]] be [[s/_said|said]] to be [[i/_its|its]] [[b/_base|base]].)**
	- _Example: A cone is an object (the apex) and a natural transformation from a constant functor (whose image is the apex of the cone and its identity morphism) to a diagram functor. Its components are projections from the apex to the objects of the diagram and it has a “naturality triangle” for each morphism in the diagram. (A “naturality triangle” is just a naturality square which is degenerate at its apex side.)_
