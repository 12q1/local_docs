- **A solid of revolution formed by rotating a triangle [[a/_around|around]] one of its [[a/_altitudes|altitudes]].**
- **A space formed by taking the direct product of a given space with a [[c/_closed|closed]] interval and identifying [[a/_all|all]] of one end to a point.**
- **[[a/_anything|Anything]] shaped like a [[c/_cone|cone]].**
- **The fruit of a [[c/_conifer|conifer]].**
- **A [[c/_cone|cone]]-shaped flower head of various plants, such as [[b/_banksias|banksias]] and proteas.**
- **An ice [[c/_cream|cream]] [[c/_cone|cone]].**
- **A traffic [[c/_cone|cone]]**
- **A unit of volume, [[a/_applied|applied]] solely to marijuana and only while it is in a smokable state; roughly 1.5 [[c/_cubic|cubic]] [[c/_centimetres|centimetres]], [[d/_depending|depending]] on use.**
- **[[a/_any|Any]] of the small [[c/_cone|cone]]-shaped structures in the retina.**
- **The [[b/_bowl|bowl]] piece on a [[b/_bong|bong]].**

- **A passenger on a [[c/_cruise|cruise]] ship (so-[[c/_called|called]] by employees [[a/_after|after]] traffic [[c/_cones|cones]], from the need to navigate [[a/_around|around]] them)**
- **An object V together with an [[a/_arrow|arrow]] going from V to each object of a diagram such that for [[a/_any|any]] [[a/_arrow|arrow]] A in the diagram, the pair of [[a/_arrows|arrows]] from V which subtend A [[a/_also|also]] [[c/_commute|commute]] with it. (Then V [[c/_can|can]] be said to be the [[c/_cone|cone]]’s vertex and the diagram which the [[c/_cone|cone]] subtends [[c/_can|can]] be said to be its [[b/_base|base]].)**
	- _Example: A cone is an object (the apex) and a natural transformation from a constant functor (whose image is the apex of the cone and its identity morphism) to a diagram functor. Its components are projections from the apex to the objects of the diagram and it has a “naturality triangle” for each morphism in the diagram. (A “naturality triangle” is just a naturality square which is degenerate at its apex side.)_
- **A shell of the genus [[c/_conus|Conus]], having a [[c/_conical|conical]] form.**
- **A set of formal languages with [[c/_certain|certain]] [[d/_desirable|desirable]] [[c/_closure|closure]] properties, in particular those of the regular languages, the [[c/_context|context]]-free languages and the recursively enumerable languages.**
