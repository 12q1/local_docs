#noun
- **An electrical switch, in a generator or motor, that periodically reverses the direction of an electric [[c/_current|current]].**
- **A [[b/_binary|binary]] map in a given group G, given by [g, h] = ghg−1h−1, where g and h are elements of G, which yields the group's identity if and only if the group operation [[c/_commutes|commutes]] for g and h.**
- **A [[b/_binary|binary]] map in a given ring R, given by [a, [[b/_b|b]]] = [[a/_ab|ab]] − [[b/_ba|ba]], where a and [[b/_b|b]] are elements of R, which yields the ring's zero element if and only if the multiplication operation [[c/_commutes|commutes]] for a and [[b/_b|b]].**
