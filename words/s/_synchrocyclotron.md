#noun
- **A [[p/_particle|particle]] [[a/_accelerator|accelerator]] [[l/_like|like]] a [[c/_cyclotron|cyclotron]], but which [[o/_operates|operates]] at variable [[f/_frequency|frequency]] to [[a/_account|account]] for the [[p/_particles|particles]] [[g/_gaining|gaining]] [[e/_energy|energy]], [[a/_allowing|allowing]] for [[g/_greater|greater]] [[e/_energies|energies]] to be [[a/_achieved|achieved]].**
	- _Example: 2004: The synchrocyclotron was able to accelerate protons to sufficient energies that collisions with nuclei produce pions, the lightest particles that, we now know, are made from a single quark and an antiquark. â€” Frank Close, Particle Physics: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford 2004, p. 50)_
