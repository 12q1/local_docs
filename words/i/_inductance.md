# Inductance
---
#noun
- **The [[p/_property|property]] of an [[e/_electric|electric]] [[c/_circuit|circuit]] by which a voltage is [[i/_induced|induced]] in it by a [[c/_changing|changing]] [[m/_magnetic|magnetic]] [[f/_field|field]].**
	- _Example: The power cable itself has enough inductance to disrupt the digital signal of the video output cable, due to poor shielding._
- **The [[q/_quantity|quantity]] of the [[r/_resulting|resulting]] [[e/_electromagnetic|electromagnetic]] [[f/_flux|flux]] [[d/_divided|divided]] by the [[c/_current|current]] that [[p/_produces|produces]] it, [[m/_measured|measured]] in [[h/_henries|henries]] ([[s/_si|SI]] [[s/_symbol|symbol]]: [[h/_h|H]].)**
	- _Example: What is the inductance of that power supply's main inductor?_
