---
#noun
- **The quality of [[b/_being|being]] [[e/_eccentric|eccentric]] or odd; [[a/_any|any]] [[e/_eccentric|eccentric]] [[b/_behaviour|behaviour]].**
- **The ratio, [[c/_constant|constant]] for [[a/_any|any]] particular [[c/_conic|conic]] section, of the [[d/_distance|distance]] of a point from the focus to its [[d/_distance|distance]] from the [[d/_directrix|directrix]].**
	- _Example: For an ellipse, the eccentricity is the ratio of the distance from the center to a focus divided by the length of the semi-major axis._
- **The [[e/_eccentricity|eccentricity]] of the [[c/_conic|conic]] section (usually an [[e/_ellipse|ellipse]]) [[d/_defined|defined]] by the orbit of a given object [[a/_around|around]] a reference object (such as that of a planet [[a/_around|around]] the sun).**
